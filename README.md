Hi, I’m @JohnMichaelCourville
I’m interested in machine/deep learning, data science/engineering
I’m currently learning a little bit of everything

I currently only have the one Stock Predictor repository and am still working on the documentation.  It is pretty straight forward though. 

<!---
JohnMichaelCourville/JohnMichaelCourville is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
