Hi, I’m @JohnMichaelCourville
I’m interested in machine/deep learning, data science/engineering
I’m currently learning a little bit of everything

I currently only have the one Stock-Alogs repository and am still working on the documentation and expanding the scope.  It is pretty straight forward though.

If you are here as a recruiter who has my resume and would like to see some code, you can view Predictor-A1.ipynb in the Price-Predictor folder in the Stock-Algos repository.  It is currently the only file containing code that I have written here.

JohnMichaelCourville/JohnMichaelCourville is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
